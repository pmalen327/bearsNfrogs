A spin on Plants VS. Zombies I made in a beginner cs class

I understand this is pretty whack and not everything is beautiful, after all, I was just a freshman lol. Basically, download everything in the same directory, run the driver class and go wild. Unfortunately, there is no termination criteria. I believe we added a health bar to the user to determine when the game ends, but I will have to dig deep in my computer for those files lol. I will update accordingly if I can find these. It is pretty basic but shows some good examples of OOP practices and methods. Just wanted to throw it up here so I have a record of it. If time ever allows, I will tweak it and make it a little smoother etc.
